# This file contains common pin mappings for MKS Robin E3 boards. To
# use this config, the firmware should be compiled for the STM32F103.
# When running "make menuconfig", enable "extra low-level
# configuration setup", select the 20KiB bootloader, and serial (on
# USART1 PA10/PA9) communication.

# Note that the "make flash" command does not work with MKS Robin
# boards. After running "make", run the following command:
#   ./scripts/update_mks_robin.py out/klipper.bin out/Robin_e3.bin
# Copy the file out/Robin_e3.bin to an SD card and then restart the
# printer with that SD card.

# MKS Robin E3 has onboard TMC2209. This config can also be used for
# MKS Robin E3D if equipped with TMC2209 stepper drivers.

# Please note pin name change for stepper Z for v1.1 of the boards.

# See docs/Config_Reference.md for a description of parameters.


# See the sample-lcd.cfg file for definitions of common LCD displays.
